Please perform an in-depth, rigorous analysis of the answers. Provide:
1. An overall composite score (0 to 100).
2. Communication Score (0-100) - Evaluating articulation, coherence, grammar, list structures, and brevity.
3. Technical Score (0-100) - Evaluating terminology accuracy, context depth, conceptual correctness, logic.
4. Confidence Score (0-100) - Evaluating assertive phrasing, lack of hesitation indicators, active verbs.
5. Problem Solving Score (0-100) - Evaluating structural approach, analytical frameworks, and result outcomes.
6. Clarity Score (0-100) - Evaluating formatting, readability, and delivery.
7. In-depth textual feedback in raw Markdown format. Write this in an elegant, inspiring, objective, and constructive style. Make sure to structure it using exactly these Markdown headings:
   - ### Core Strengths: (Detailed review of what they nailed)
   - ### Areas for Improvement: (Constructive criticism of missed marks, logic flaws, or superficial explanations)
   - ### 4-Week Personalized Improvement Plan: (Provide a week-by-week step-by-step custom actionable schedule)
   - ### Perfect Sample Answers: Provide 1-2 examples of high-performing model answers for the questions they struggled with.`;
